# chest-xray-pneumonia-detection  

## Project Description  
A project for detecting pneumonia using chest X-ray images. A deep learning model is trained to analyze medical images and classify cases as either "Normal" or "Pneumonia."  

## Project Features  
- **Model**: Based on deep neural networks using TensorFlow/Keras.  
- **Dataset**: A collection of chest X-ray images classified into normal and pneumonia cases.  
- **Accuracy**: The model's performance has been optimized to achieve high accuracy in detection.  

## Requirements  
- Python 3.8 or higher  Required libraries:  
  - TensorFlow  
  - Keras  
  - NumPy  
  - Matplotlib
